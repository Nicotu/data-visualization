# Data visualization app

This app will process a data file and display the data as both a sortable table and a set of charts using Chartjs react library. 

### Routes

`/` Index with sortable table <br />
`/charts` A set of chart showing some data grouped in brackets to make it more 'chart friendly'. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.
